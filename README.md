## Features

The dashboard identifies content that may need attention without presenting the result as an official Microsoft assessment. Every request uses the selected site's `siteId`; changing the selection clears the existing results.

This extension illustrates the following concepts:

- Microsoft Graph site search, paginated site-page metadata retrieval, and selected-page `canvasLayout` retrieval
- Unit-testable rules for missing descriptions, potentially stale content, short content, older year references, and generic titles
- Transparent Content Health Scores from 0 to 100 with Healthy, Needs Attention, and High Priority statuses
